# Replacement-for-TMD1TM26
This is a replacement part for a NormPacific TMD1TM26 Dryer timer 

This electronic part has a mayor flaw, due to the heavy use of it and the amount of force required to move it, it tends to break the knob that goes outside of it.
Because of this i also managed to break an inside plastic part responsible of adjusting the timer itself.
So this is a 3D replacemnt part ive used so i didnt had to buy a brand new part (~100USD) 
I recomend using PLA if you want to 3d print it.

I hope you find it usefull
